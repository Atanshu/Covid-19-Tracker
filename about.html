                    <div class="about-content">
                        <p>I am an aspiring web developer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different
                            disciplines,
                            people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong
                            technical skills and
                            an academic background in engineering, front end development, and basics of backend.</p>
                        <p>My passion lies in designing beautiful and responsive websites with tailored sections and
                            communicating
                            complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver
                            high-performing
                            websites.

                        <p>In my graduate studies, I did many extra-curricular activities as well. I was the part of the
                            core team
                            which organized the Shri Akhand Path Sahib in Dehradun. I was also a part of the technical
                            team of our
                            college's technical and cultural fests. I also participated in various webinars, seminars,
                            and
                            competitions.</p>

                        <p>I'm graduating in May 2021 and I'm interested in full-stack web development roles. Please
                            feel free to get
                            in touch with me via email at goelatanshu0106@gmail.com.</p>
